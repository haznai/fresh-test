          Developed a web application to recommend the right statistical tool
          for sampling datapoints. The application was developed together with a
          Ph.D. student at the Zurich People and Computing lab.

          VirtualWardrobe is a cross-platform application I created for my
          bachelor thesis. The premise is simple, make your wardrobe portable by
          digitally carrying your pictures of your clothing with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          A custom machine learning model processed the pictures to crop and
          categorize the clothes. Embedding the machine learning model ensured
          that the pictures stay private and never leave your own devices (iOS,
          iPadOS, macOS) or private cloud (iCloud).

          This project was done in a cooperation between my German university
          and a big german client. The goal was to predict the day the customer
          is most likely to purchase an item. The development of an artificial
          intelligence to solve this task was documented in a scientific thesis

          Padessi is the outcome of an internal company hackathon. Our idea was
          a mobile application that showed employees of the company free parking
          spaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Raspberry Pi equipped with a camera periodically took pictures of
          the company parking lot. An artificial intelligence on the Pi analyzed
          the images and reported the free parking spaces to a server. Our team
          won third place out of more than 30 teams.
